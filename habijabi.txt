join query: 
(cross product+ some condition) == table size (m*n)

find which tables i need to use;
when i need to fetch data from two or more tables;
there must be common attributes in these tables;

select employee_name from employees,departments where employees.employee_id=departments.employee_id;
select employee_name from employees natural join department;
select employee_name from employees (e) join departments (d) on employees.employee_id=departments.employee_id;

-- join and natural join or inner join is same.

-- join is used after from clause. if i use equality instead of join, then i use it in where clause such as; where t1.col1=t2.col3;

* Natural join: If the tables COUNTRIES and CITIES have two common columns named COUNTRY and COUNTRY_ISO_CODE,
select * from countries natural join cities;

*** how to visualize when natural join performs on two common columns???
